## Two Boys Recreate Harry Potter Theme Using Washing Machines
用洗衣机演奏哈利波特主题曲，爆红网络

YouTuber and TikTok artist Kurt Schneider describes himself as ‘CEO of music with weird things’ on one of his handles, and he lived up to it by recreating the Harry Potter theme music on the control panel of a washing machine. The recreation of the tune impressed even author JK Rowling, who retweeted it.

Aided by his friend Jason Pitts, Schneider played the tune on a washing machine while dressed like Harry Potter. While Schneider played with the keys of the machine to produce the music, Pitts provided the beats. 
在他的朋友JP的帮助下，KS穿着哈利波特的服装在洗衣机上演奏。当KS在机器上按键弹奏时，JP帮他打拍子。

It was shared on TikTok with the caption: “Harry Potter doing laundry be like”. Schneider later said that it took over five hours to get the tune right. But what impressed Potterheads was the ending of the video, in which Schneider crawled into a closet under the stairs, much like the beloved character.
