## Are You Caught in a Spiral of Silence?
沉默的螺旋：你陷入过其中吗？

“I didn’t speak up. I didn’t say anything. I thought maybe I was wrong.” 
“我不敢大声说话，什么都不敢说。我感觉自己有毛病。”

Some employees often say this, disgruntled and frustrated. 
一些员工总是低落沮丧着说。

What they say next usually follows along these lines: “I was right all along but I didn’t have the courage to speak up.” Or “My voice never gets heard. I have great ideas but I just can’t get them on the table.” In short, they didn’t take the situation head on and speak up. 
这些人通常还会这样说：“我的直觉都是对的，但我不敢说出来。”或者“我说的从来都没人听。我有一个特别棒的点子，但就是无法在摆上台来说。” 简而言之，他们无法直面这种情况，并大声说出来。

Most of us are hesitant to express opinions when we think our viewpoint is not widely shared. This has been referred to as the “spiral of silence.” 
当人们认为自己的观点不会被广泛认同时，大多数人会羞于表达。这种现象被称为“沉默的漩涡”。

A research finds that even with a smorgasbord of communication opportunities in our electronic world, people are less likely to speak up about issues when they think their viewpoint is not widely shared. 
一项研究表明，就算是在充满各种交流机会的网上，如果其观点不被多数人认同，人们还是不愿意表达自己的观点。

People who believe their friends and followers disagree with them are less likely to state their views, online or face-to-face. The more we are exposed to the diverse opinions out there, the more tempted we might be to remain neutral—or at least silent—even when we may feel passionate about our viewpoint. 
如果朋友或者粉丝不同意他们的观点，那么人们就不愿表达自己的观点，不管是在线上还是线下。

Research shows that most of us rely on friends and associates to express their opinions before we offer our own. This is especially true of our teens. They are notably reluctant to appear out of step with their peers. 

So why are teens reluctant to diverge from the group norm? They may be afraid of negative feedback, rejection, ridicule or losing friends. There is also the permanence of the Internet. A careless comment, even an unpopular viewpoint, will linger in cyberspace forever—possibly affecting one’s public image or advancement later.
