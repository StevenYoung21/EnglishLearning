Apple WWDC 2020
iOS14发布，苹果2020开发者大会来了

Apple announced new software for its iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TV and Apple Watch on Monday. It also said future Macs — including one that will launch later this year — will use chips made by Apple instead of Intel. 
周一，苹果针对旗下的手机，平板电脑，mac电脑和苹果电视发布了新软件。并且，mac电脑（包括今年年底发布的款式）将会采用自家开发的芯片来替换因特尔的芯片。

Apple said the transition from Intel will enable the company to offer faster performance on its laptops and desktops. 
苹果公司称这次芯片的更替将会为笔记本和台式机提供更快的性能。

Apple also introduced iOS 14, the latest version of the iPhone software, which includes updates such as the ability to set a default mail app or browser app, a redesigned home screen, and new lightweight software programs called “App Clips.” 
苹果这次还推出了iOS14系统，这是iphone最新的系统。这次更新包过可以设置默认邮箱应用、默认浏览器，新的桌面视图，和一项名为“App Clips”的小程序。

The new software was announced in a prerecorded video filmed at Apple’s campus. Apple CEO Tim Cook acted as a master of ceremonies, briefly introducing Apple employees to present new features. Apple’s WWDC conference is being held remotely this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
这次的发布会是提前在苹果大楼里录制好的。苹果的CEO蒂姆库克担任主持，他简要地向苹果员工介绍了产品的新功能。由于新冠疫情的影响，苹果这次的发布会采取线上模式。

iOS 14

The most notable change comes in the form of widgets that you can place on the home screen. It’s like if Apple Watch apps invaded the iPhone home screen — it’s a really big deal that changes the look of the iOS software. Apple is debuting these new widgets in different shapes and sizes, and the idea is that you’ll be able to have more data-rich info on your home screen. If you want more, you’ll be able to get them through the Widget Gallery. 


It is also adding App Library, a new feature that automatically organizes apps based on their categories. It seems great for quickly accessing apps that normally live outside of the first or second page. 
IOS14还增加了APP资源库功能，该功能会自动管理手机内的app，对其进行分类。这快速访问用平时常用的app似乎是一件很棒的事情。

Picture-in-picture is coming to iOS 14. If you swipe away while watching a full-screened video, the window will float on your home screen, allowing you to resize and move the video. PiP isn’t a super unique feature, but Apple is making it its own by letting you minimize the PiP into a small button on the side of the screen. That way, you don’t have to exit the video if you need to look at the whole screen for a moment. 
IOS14将支持画中画功能。当你对全屏播放的视频进行滑动手势操作，视频窗口将会缩小浮动在桌面上，你也可以随意拖动视频窗口和调节其大小。画中画功能并非其独有，但苹果公司赋予了它全新的特色，视频可以折叠最小化在屏幕侧边。这种方式的设计可以让你查看其他应用时不必退出视频的播放。
