## WeChat Rolls Out Credit Scoring System
微信支付分上线：小马哥835分，你多少

Following Alibaba’s Alipay, Tencent’s messaging and payment app WeChat has officially rolled out a personal credit rating system to determine the trustworthiness of users via their payment behavior and credit history on the platform, according to a report from media outlet Jiemian. 
界面新闻报道，在阿里巴巴公司的支付宝之后，腾讯旗下的通讯支付软件微信也推出了个人信用积分系统，该系统通过通过用户在平台上的支付行为和信用历史来评定用户信用等级。

Named “WeChat Pay Score,” the new AI-assisted system is accessible through the WeChat Pay tab but is only available to users who have completed real-name verification. Before activating the feature, users will also be given a notice about how many of their contacts are already using the service. 
该系统名为“微信支付积分”，这个由AI辅助的系统可以通过微信支付标签来查看，但仅限于已经完成实名认证的用户。在该功能激活之前，用户会收到有多少个好友开通了该功能的通知。

Depending on users’ WeChat Pay Score, they can have access to a maximum of 1038 personal-credit related services. With a high enough credit score, users can rent items such as home water purifiers, power banks, and tablets deposit free from designated service providers. Several ride-hailing and hotel service platforms have also been connected to the credit system. 
基于微信支付积分系统，用户最多可以关联1038个个人信用相关的服务。高积分的用户可以享有一些免押金服务，例如家庭净水器、充电宝和平板电脑等。一些网约车和酒店服务平台也接入该信用系统。

Credit scores on the system vary widely, ranging from as low as 300 to as high as 850. According to Chinese media reports, Tencent’s chairman and CEO, Pony Ma, had a WeChat Pay Score of 835, though WeChat soon revealed that there are scores as high as 848. 
该系统的信用分值高低不等，最低300，最高可达850。据中国媒体报道，腾讯CEO马总的信用积分问835，但微信很快披露最高分值到达了848。

WeChat has started testing its credit score system since as early as 2018, though the tests were generally on a small scale. In August 2019, Geng Zhijun, the vice president of Weixin Group, said the credit rating system has helped users save tens of billions in deposits in three months. The messaging app also said it has plans to expand use scenarios for WeChat Pay Score. 


Tencent’s credit rating system is similar to Alipay’s Zhima Credit, or Sesame Credit, which calculates users’ credit scores based on a variety of factors such as purchases on Alibaba’s e-commerce apps and spending using Alipay’s mobile wallet.
腾讯的积分等级系统类似于阿里巴巴支付宝的芝麻信用。用户的积分受到多方面因素来决定，例如在在淘宝上的购买能力，在支付宝上的支付能力等。
