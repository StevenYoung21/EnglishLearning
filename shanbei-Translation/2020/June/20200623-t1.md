## Last Third-Gen Beidou Satellite Fired Into Orbit
北斗收官之星，飞天成功直奔苍穹

The final satellite to complete the third-generation network of China's Beidou Navigation Satellite System was launched on Tuesday morning, marking a new milestone in the nation's space endeavors. 
周二早上，我国成功发射北斗系统的最后一刻卫星，暨北斗三号最后一颗全球组网卫星，这是我国航天事业的新里程碑。

As the countdown ticked to zero — 9:43 am — at the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province, eight engines on the first stage and four boosters of a Long March 3B carrier rocket spat orange flame as they lifted the 19-story vehicle and satellite into cloudy skies. 
在四川省西昌卫星发射中心，当倒计时归零时（早9点43分），长征三号乙运载火箭的八个发动机和四个助推器成功将19层楼高的飞行器和卫星送入天空，喷射出橙色的火焰。

The launch marked the completion of the in-orbit construction of Beidou, the country's largest space-based system and one of four global navigation networks, along with the United States' GPS, Russia's GLONASS and the European Union's Galileo. 
本次卫星的成功发射标志着北斗系统在轨部署完成，北斗是国内最大的空间导航系统，也是全球四大导航系统之一，其他三个分别为美国全球定位系统、俄罗斯格洛纳斯以及欧盟伽利略。

After a period of in-orbit tests, the new satellite will start formal operations and work with other Beidou satellites, allowing users around the globe to access high-accuracy navigation, positioning and timing services according to the China Satellite Navigation Office. 


The spacecraft, which was transported by rail to the Xichang center on April 4, was designed and made by the China Academy of Space Technology, a subsidiary of State-owned space conglomerate China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. Based on the DFH-3B satellite platform, it is designed to work in orbit for at least 12 years.
