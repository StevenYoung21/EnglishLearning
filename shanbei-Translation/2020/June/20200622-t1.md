Amazon said it's developed a new artificial intelligence system to help maintain social distancing in its warehouses, and it plans to share the underlying technology for free. 
亚马逊声称他们新开发了一套人工智能系统，来帮助人们保持其社交距离，并且计划将底层技术开源。

Called Distance Assistant, the tech involves a 50-inch monitor, camera and laptop set up on a mount. The camera tracks how closely people are walking near each other, showing workers walking by the device augmented-reality circles around them. The circles remain green if someone is six feet away from others but turns red if they get too close together. 
这项技术命名为“距离助手”，这套系统配有一个50英寸的显示器，摄像头和本地计算设备。摄像头将检测是否有人靠近你，如果工人之间相互靠近，则设备会增强显示。如果距离保持在6英尺之内，以绿色圆圈显示，而距离较近则以红色圆圈显示。

The first Distance Assistant systems have already been set up in a handful of Amazon buildings, and the company said it plans to deploy hundreds of these devices in the next few weeks to provide employees with this immediate visual feedback. 
第一批的“距离助手”已经安装在亚马逊公司的少数建筑楼中，公司称该项目得到了员工们的积极反馈，我们将在接下来的几周内继续部署上百个这样的设备。

The software used in Distance Assistant will be provided as open-source, so other companies can create their own similar devices without paying Amazon a licensing fee. 
“距离助手”的软件已开源，其他公司可以免费使用其软件来开发自己相似的设备，并且不需要想亚马逊支付许可费。

Distance Assistant also builds off Amazon's work with computer vision, using the concept to power its Amazon Go stores.
